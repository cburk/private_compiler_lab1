Since this project is written in Python, it uses no makefile, just a BASH script called
412alloc to run the python.

To get help/a list of commands, run:
	./412alloc -h

To use the allocator just to rename an ILOC block (referred to as ccX.i) to virtual registers, run:
	./412alloc -x ccX.i
	
To use the allocator w/ allocating a given number of registers (k), run:
	./412alloc k ccX.i
